    "[GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org) adds a spatial geometry data type to `Pandas` and enables spatial operations on these types, using [shapely](http://toblerity.org/shapely/). GeoPandas leverages Pandas together with several core open source geospatial packages and practices to provide a uniquely simple and convenient framework for handling geospatial feature data, operating on both geometries and attributes jointly, and as with Pandas, largely eliminating the need to iterate over features (rows). Also as with Pandas, it adds a very convenient and fine-tuned plotting method, and read/write methods that handle multiple file and \"serialization\" formats."

GeoPandas can help you manage and pre-process the data, and do initial visualizations.\n",
